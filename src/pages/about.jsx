          Here in the U.S., we enjoy easy access to quality healthcare and
          medicines - most of us can take a short drive to a nearby clinic,
          hospital, or pharmacy and receive what we need (even if it is a bit
          pricey at times!). It can be easy to think that most people have this
          level of access to healthcare. To the contrary, the World Health
          Organization reports that over half the worldâ€™s population does not
          have adequate access to quality healthcare.
